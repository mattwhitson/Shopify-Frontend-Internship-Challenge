# About
This is Shopify's Frontend Internship Challenge that I have built with Next.js, TailwindCSS, and NASA's APOD API! 

# Deployment URL

# Key Features
* Light and Dark Mode that can be easily toggled
* Add and remove likes that are stored in cookies
* Links to individual photo pages for a higher resolution image
* Ability to sort either randomly or in chronological order, as well as being able to specify the chronological sorting start date 
* Loading symbol when switching between sorting methods
* Infinite scrolling with a loading symbol at the bottom while the site is fetching the next page of images
* Server Side Rendering of initial page with incremental static regneration for better SEO
* Added video support since I noticed some of the APOD posts are videos
* Fully responsive on all devices
