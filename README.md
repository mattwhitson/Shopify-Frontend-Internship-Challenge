# About
This is Shopify's Frontend Internship Challenge that I have built with Next.js, TailwindCSS, and NASA's APOD API! It supports both a light and dark mode, the ability to add and remove likes that are stored via cookies, links to see photos in a higher resolution individually, the ability to sort Chronologically, Randomly, or Chronologically starting from a specified date, and it's fully responsive for devices of all sizes! Thank you for taking the time to check it out!
